ðŸŒ±  Currently studying at 42Lausanne <br>
ðŸ§   Working on cub3d project: This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
